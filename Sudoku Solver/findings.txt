mystery1.dat is the extremely hard puzzle with 514,267 recursions.
mystery2.dat is the unsolvable puzzle.
mystery3.dat is the hard puzzle with 27,330 recursions.

This is because mystery2 could not be solved by the function
solve_board(board) which solves anything that is not impossible. 
The function calls itself recursively and if necessary guesses the
numbers incrementally until the solution is found.

mystery1 is much harder than mystery 3 because the solve_board
function had to call itself recursively many more times to reach the solution.

The number of times solve_board must call itself recursively is
measured in the 'count' reference parameter of the modified solve
function that is solve_board(board, count).

Recursion number or count is directly proportional to the difficulty of the
puzzle because the function only calls itself again when trying to
fill a number into a blank if the number also works in
the current row, column and box. If one of these conditions
were false, the current number can be dismissed as a candidate without
calling the function again recusively - dramatically reducing the
number of possibilities and the amount of guesswork. While a human
couldn't figure the whole thing out recursively, they could also
eliminate possibilities using the row, column and box check if the
sudoku allows them which would make it easier.
